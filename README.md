<h4 align="left">Hello World!!🌎 My name is Joaquin Rodriguez, I am 18 years old and I am on an exciting journey🚀 towards the world of programming👾, specifically focused on the front-end. Currently, I am studying at the National Technological University (UTN)📖, my idea is to be able to bring websites and applications to life, offering interactive and attractive experiences for users. I consider an internship as a front-end programmer to be an invaluable opportunity. To continue learning would be a great advance for my experience, in addition I would be working on real projects and collaborating with experienced professionals. Out of code, I have activities that help me stay balanced and energized. One of them is the gym, where I enjoy working on my physical and mental health, always seeking to exceed my limits and reach new goals. Also, I love bodyboarding and going for a run. Technology and web design are more than just a career for me; They represent a true passion. Every project I start becomes an opportunity to express my creativity and love for digital aesthetics.</h4>
